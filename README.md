# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenges in This Course


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Results
Programmer added alt tags to images, corrected browser tab title, and confirmed HTML and CSS was laid out
 in a logical well formed manner.
 
Future changes should include the hover feature to highlight the menu item the user is hovering over as well as the 
 section being hovered on to change background color.
